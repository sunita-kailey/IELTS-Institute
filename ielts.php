            <h2> Why IELTS?</h2>
        
        <p>Students aspiring to study in the topmost universities and colleges of the English-speaking 
		world need to clear an English language proficiency test. Non-native speakers of English have
		to show that they can read, write, speak, and understand English, so as to be able to follow 
		lectures, study, take exams, and interact comfortably with fellow students, teachers and the 
		local population. For this purpose as well as for the purpose of immigration, a standardised 
		English language proficiency test for non-native English spea-kers has been established as a
		pre-requisite for the selection process. IELTS is the worldâ€™s most popular English language 
		proficiency test and a world of opportunity awaits those who clear the required scores.</p>
