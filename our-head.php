<!--<h2>WORDS FROM OUR HEAD</h2>-->
    <p>I have been coaching IELTS and TOEFL students from over 13 years now.My passion for teaching landed me into IELTS coaching ,although primarily I am a gynaecologist.</P>
	
	 <p>The day since I started coaching for IELTS I have seen all types of students from weak to mediocre to very intelligent students.I noticed the pattern of mistakes in all types of students and i noticed most of the students make same mistakes and just need proper guidance to succed.Through these years I have tested many methods and techniques which could work for my students and I have put all those useful methods and techniques in books so that my students can get benifitted from them.
	  we have a series of books for IELTS available at our store.our pdf versions of all books can also be made available to you after your subscription to our packages.
